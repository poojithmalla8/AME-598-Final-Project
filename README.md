###Introduction
Smart Agriculture can help in increasing the efficiency of the harvest process and also reduce production costs and production loss. So, predicting the
type of crop based on soil properties would help in reducing production loss and help in generating maximum harvest and best quality crop. The proposed system connects the agricultural field to the internet and extracts real-time farm information and uses this data in predicting the soil condition and suggesting the crop to harvest for the season. This system uses the sensor, server, and ML model to improve the quality of the harvest and make the best out of the soil.
